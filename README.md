# Healthcare_Analysis
This project analyzes health data, including physiological measurements and patient records, to identify trends and potential health risks.  It aims to provide insights into the distribution of various health indicators within a given population.

## Introduction

This project focuses on health monitoring and analysis, encompassing a range of activities from collecting real-time physiological data (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, etc.) to analyzing complex health records (patient history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information).  This particular analysis examines the distribution of key health indicators like age group, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.

## Observations

The following key observations were made from the data analysis:

* **Distribution of Age Groups:** The 'Senior' category has the highest representation in the dataset, followed by 'Young' and 'Middle-aged' individuals.
* **Distribution of Blood Pressure Categories:**  The majority of the dataset falls under 'Normal' blood pressure. 'Elevated' and 'Hypertension Stage 1' are less common, and 'Hypertension Stage 2' is the least frequent.
* **Distribution of Heart Rate Categories:** Most individuals have a 'Normal' heart rate, with very few instances of 'Low' or 'High' heart rates.
* **Distribution of Oxygen Saturation Categories:**  Almost all individuals have 'Normal' oxygen saturation levels, with minimal cases of 'Low' saturation.

These observations provide a snapshot of the health status within the analyzed dataset.  Further analysis could explore correlations between these indicators and other factors.
